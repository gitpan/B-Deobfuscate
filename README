B::Deobfuscate version 0.01
==========================

B::DeObfuscate is a backend module for the Perl compiler that generates perl
source code, based on the internal compiled structure that perl itself
creates after parsing a program. It adds symbol renaming functions to the
B::Deparse module. An obfuscated program is already parsed and interpreted
correctly by the B::Deparse program. Unfortunately, if the obfuscation
involved variable renaming then the resulting program also has obfuscated
symbols.

This module takes the last step and fixes names like $z5223ed336 to be a word
from a dictionary. While the name still isn't meaningful it is at least
easier to distinguish and read.
